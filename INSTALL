cl-mpi can be loaded with ASDF (www.common-lisp.net/project/asdf/). However it
has some non-Lisp dependencies:

* An MPI implementation
  On your supercomputer, there is usually some vendor-specific version of
  MPI. On your desktop system, there are plenty of free MPI implementations
  like OpenMPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/) or MPICH (http://www.mpich.org/)
  that you can install manually or with a package manager.
* A C Compiler + mpicc
  Usually MPI provides a small wrapper around the systems C compiler named
  "mpicc". If cl-mpi fails to load, it is most certainly because there is no
  program named mpicc or mpicc is not able to produce shared libraries. If you
  encounter this problem, please let me know or send me a patch.
